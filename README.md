#Age calculator
 I tried to create an age calculator however I ran into a few problems.

#1.
  I'm not sure how to calculate the age, I suppose you have to subtract the current date from the D.O.

#2
  Whilst testing it out on my browser, I wasn't receiving a pop up of the information. I guess this is because the computer doesn't know what to display.

#3
  I want to try and experiment more with css but am unsure about how to go about it.
